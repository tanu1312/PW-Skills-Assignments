CSS Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout):

Purpose: Flexbox is designed for creating one-dimensional layouts, typically either in rows or columns. It's ideal for arranging elements along a single axis.
Main Features:
Flex containers allow you to distribute space among child elements evenly or based on their content.
Elements inside a flex container can vary in size to fill available space.
Flexbox is great for aligning items within a container.
Use Cases: Flexbox is often used for navigation menus, sidebars, and other simple, one-dimensional layouts where elements need to be aligned horizontally or vertically.
CSS Grid:

Purpose: CSS Grid is designed for creating two-dimensional layouts, allowing you to define both rows and columns and position items anywhere within the grid.
Main Features:
You can create complex grid structures with different-sized rows and columns.
Items can be placed explicitly within specific grid cells.
CSS Grid is highly versatile and allows for more control over the layout.
Use Cases: CSS Grid is ideal for creating more complex layouts, such as entire webpage structures, card grids, and any layout where precise control over item placement is required.
When to Choose Flexbox or Grid:

Use Flexbox when:

You have a one-dimensional layout (either rows or columns).
You want to distribute space among items in a container evenly or based on their content.
You need to align items along a single axis.
Use CSS Grid when:

You have a two-dimensional layout (both rows and columns).
You want to create complex layouts with precise control over item placement.
You need to create responsive designs where items can automatically adapt to available space.
In many cases, you may find that a combination of both Flexbox and CSS Grid is useful, as they can complement each other in creating sophisticated and responsive layouts. Flexbox is often used for smaller-scale components within a Grid layout to achieve alignment and distribution along a single axis.z
