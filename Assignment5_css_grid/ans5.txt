justify-items and justify-self are CSS properties used in conjunction with CSS Grid to control the horizontal alignment of grid items within a grid container. They determine how grid items are aligned along the inline axis (horizontal, typically left-to-right) within their grid cells. Let's explore the differences between them with code examples.

justify-items:
justify-items is applied to the grid container and affects the alignment of all grid items within the container.
css
Copy code
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
  justify-items: center; /* Horizontally centers all grid items */
}

.grid-item {
  background-color: lightblue;
}
html
Copy code
<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-item">Item 1</div>
  <div class="grid-item">Item 2</div>
</div>
In this example, justify-items: center; aligns all grid items horizontally to the center within their respective grid cells.

justify-self:
justify-self is applied to individual grid items and allows you to override the alignment of a specific grid item.
css
Copy code
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
}

.grid-item {
  background-color: lightblue;
  justify-self: end; /* Aligns this specific grid item to the end of its cell */
}
html
Copy code
<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="grid-item">Item 1</div>
  <div class="grid-item">Item 2</div>
</div>
In this example, justify-self: end; aligns only the second grid item to the end of its cell, while the first item retains the default alignment (center) determined by justify-items.

To summarize:

justify-items sets the default horizontal alignment for all grid items within the grid container.
justify-self allows you to override the default alignment for individual grid items.
These properties are also applicable for the vertical alignment of grid items, but you would use align-items and align-self for that purpose.
