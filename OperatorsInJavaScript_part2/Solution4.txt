Here's how you can use a ternary operator in JavaScript to check whether a person is eligible to vote based on their age:

javascript code
let age = parseInt(prompt("Enter your age:"));

let message = age < 18 ? "You cannot vote" : "You can vote";

console.log(message);
In this example:

We prompt the user to enter their age using prompt(), convert it to an integer using parseInt(), and store it in the variable age.
We use a ternary operator to check the value of age:
If age is less than 18, we assign the string "You cannot vote" to the variable message.
If age is greater than or equal to 18, we assign the string "You can vote" to the variable message.
Finally, we log the message to the console using console.log().
