        <dt>MEAN Stack</dt>
        <dd>A JavaScript-based tech stack consisting of MongoDB (database), Express.js (web application framework), Angular (front-end framework), and Node.js (runtime environment). Used for building dynamic and scalable web applications.</dd>
    
        <dt>MERN Stack</dt>
        <dd>Another JavaScript-based tech stack similar to MEAN but replaces Angular with React as the front-end framework. It's used for building modern and interactive web applications.</dd>
    
        <dt>LAMP Stack</dt>
        <dd>Short for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP/Python/Perl, the LAMP stack is a classic open-source tech stack for building web applications. Linux serves as the operating system, Apache as the web server, MySQL as the database, and PHP/Python/Perl as the server-side scripting language.</dd>
    
        <dt>Ruby on Rails (RoR)</dt>
        <dd>A framework that uses the Ruby programming language to build web applications quickly. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and focuses on convention over configuration.</dd>
    
        <dt>MEVN Stack</dt>
        <dd>Similar to MERN, the MEVN stack uses Vue.js as the front-end framework instead of React. It's used for creating modern web applications with Vue.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Node.js.</dd>
    
        <dt>Django</dt>
        <dd>A Python-based web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) pattern and is known for its simplicity and readability.</dd>
