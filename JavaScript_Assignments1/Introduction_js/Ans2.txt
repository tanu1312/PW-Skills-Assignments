
In JavaScript, operators are symbols that perform operations on operands. They can be categorized based on their functionality into several groups. Here are the main categories:

Arithmetic Operators:

These operators perform basic arithmetic operations.
Addition: + Example: let result = 5 + 3;
Subtraction: - Example: let result = 5 - 3;
Multiplication: * Example: let result = 5 * 3;
Division: / Example: let result = 5 / 3;
Modulus: % Example: let remainder = 5 % 3;
Comparison Operators:

Used to compare values and return a Boolean result.
Equal to: == or === Example: let isEqual = (5 === '5');
Not equal to: != or !== Example: let isNotEqual = (5 !== '5');
Greater than: > Example: let isGreater = (5 > 3);
Less than: < Example: let isLess = (5 < 3);
Greater than or equal to: >= Example: let isGreaterOrEqual = (5 >= 3);
Less than or equal to: <= Example: let isLessOrEqual = (5 <= 3);
Logical Operators:

Used to combine or manipulate Boolean values.
Logical AND: && Example: let andResult = (true && false);
Logical OR: || Example: let orResult = (true || false);
Logical NOT: ! Example: let notResult = !true;
Assignment Operators:

Used to assign values to variables.
Assignment: = Example: let x = 5;
Addition assignment: += Example: x += 3; (Equivalent to x = x + 3;)
Subtraction assignment: -= Example: x -= 3; (Equivalent to x = x - 3;)
Multiplication assignment: *= Example: x *= 3; (Equivalent to x = x * 3;)
Division assignment: /= Example: x /= 3; (Equivalent to x = x / 3;)
Unary Operators:

Operators that act on a single operand.
Unary plus: + Example: let positiveNumber = +5;
Unary minus: - Example: let negativeNumber = -5;
Increment: ++ Example: let incremented = x++;
Decrement: -- Example: let decremented = x--;
Ternary Operator (Conditional Operator):

A shorthand way of writing an if-else statement.
Ternary Operator: condition ? expr1 : expr2 Example: let result = (x > 0) ? 'positive' : 'negative';
These categories cover the basic operators in JavaScript, providing a foundation for performing a wide range of operations in the language.
