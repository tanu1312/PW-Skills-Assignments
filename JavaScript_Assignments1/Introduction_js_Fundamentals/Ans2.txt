HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):
Purpose:

HTML is a markup language used for structuring content on the web. It defines the structure of a web page, specifying elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more.
Example Use Cases:

Document Structure: Defining the overall structure of a web page.

html code:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
  <p>This is the main content of the page.</p>
</body>
</html>
Text and Multimedia Content: Adding text, images, videos, and other media to a webpage.

html code:
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
<img src="image.jpg" alt="An example image">
Links and Navigation: Creating hyperlinks to navigate between pages.

html code:
<a href="page2.html">Go to Page 2</a>
JavaScript:
Purpose:

JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It allows developers to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), handle events, and perform computations.
Example Use Cases:

Event Handling: Responding to user actions such as clicks, key presses, or form submissions.

html code:
<button onclick="myFunction()">Click me</button>
<script>
  function myFunction() {
    alert("Button clicked!");
  }
</script>
Dynamic Content: Updating content on the page dynamically based on user input or other events.

html code:
<p id="demo">This is a paragraph.</p>
<button onclick="changeText()">Change Text</button>
<script>
  function changeText() {
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Text changed!";
  }
</script>
AJAX Requests: Fetching data from a server asynchronously without reloading the entire page.

html code:
<button onclick="loadData()">Load Data</button>
<div id="dataContainer"></div>
<script>
  function loadData() {
    // AJAX request to fetch data from the server
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => {
        document.getElementById('dataContainer').innerHTML = data.message;
      });
  }
</script>
In summary, HTML is used for structuring content and defining the static elements of a web page, while JavaScript is used to add interactivity, handle events, and dynamically update the content based on user actions or other events. They complement each other to create a complete and engaging web experience.
