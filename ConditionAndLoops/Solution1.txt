Conditional statements, also known as control structures, are programming constructs that allow you to execute different blocks of code based on whether a certain condition evaluates to true or false. Conditional statements are fundamental in programming as they enable the creation of flexible and dynamic code.

The most common types of conditional statements are:

if statement: It allows you to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true.

if-else statement: It allows you to execute one block of code if a specified condition is true and another block of code if the condition is false.

if-else-if ladder: It allows you to test multiple conditions sequentially and execute the corresponding block of code for the first condition that evaluates to true.

switch statement: It allows you to execute different blocks of code based on the value of an expression.

Here's the syntax for each type of conditional statement:

if statement:
 code
if (condition) {
    // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}
if-else statement:
 code
if (condition) {
    // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
    // block of code to be executed if the condition is false
}
if-else-if ladder:
 code
if (condition1) {
    // block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // block of code to be executed if condition2 is true
} else if (condition3) {
    // block of code to be executed if condition3 is true
}
// add more else if blocks if necessary
else {
    // block of code to be executed if all conditions are false
}
switch statement:
 code
switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        // block of code to be executed if expression equals value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // block of code to be executed if expression equals value2
        break;
    // add more case blocks if necessary
    default:
        // block of code to be executed if expression doesn't match any case
}
Now, let's provide examples for each type of conditional statement:

if statement:
javascript code
let num = 10;
if (num > 0) {
    console.log("Number is positive");
}
if-else statement:
javascript code
let num = -5;
if (num > 0) {
    console.log("Number is positive");
} else {
    console.log("Number is non-positive");
}
if-else-if ladder:
javascript code
let num = 0;
if (num > 0) {
    console.log("Number is positive");
} else if (num < 0) {
    console.log("Number is negative");
} else {
    console.log("Number is zero");
}
switch statement:
javascript code
let day = "Monday";
switch (day) {
    case "Monday":
        console.log("It's Monday!");
        break;
    case "Tuesday":
        console.log("It's Tuesday!");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("It's neither Monday nor Tuesday.");
}
